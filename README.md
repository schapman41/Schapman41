I am a recent graduate from the Master of Data Science program at the University of Guelph, as well as a graduate of the data science certificate program at George Brown, and the Bachelor of Science honours program at Guelph, with a major in Environmental Biology. 

My primary career interest is promoting the sustainability of businesses using data driven insights. I am of the belief that quantitative analysis is a strong motivator for action within most business environments. Since data science is applicable in a variety of industries, I also have secondary interests in sports analytics, healthcare and politics.

Through my education, I have gained the skills necessary to perform complex quantitative analysis using a variety of software tools. My strong technical communication skills allow me to communicate complex information to various audiences including team members or stakeholders. These communications can be through written reports, visual dashboards or in person/online presentations.
